## 1. Lab Presentation
I had to give a presentation solo on a parer which explores how deep learning models like LSTM and Transformer can predict and optimize Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) in cloud computing. It focuses on using real-world cloud data to train models that anticipate and prevent performance issues. The study finds that while both models perform well, the Transformer model excels in handling new data and unexpected scenarios. The research integrates findings with the Polaris SLO Cloud framework for real-time cloud management. Future work aims to refine long-term predictions and implement models in real-world cloud systems.
